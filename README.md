# 737
This script came when my nephew rash to the living room to find a ruler,
Guess what do he do with the ruler?

He count the distance between jakarta and the famous city around the world,
I think it's a great idea to turn into a script,
That's why I create this python scriptðŸ˜€

The time is actually only available for boing 737 (well that explains the nameðŸ˜‚)
