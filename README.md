# Airplane-time
This script came when my nephew rash to the living room to find a ruler,
Guess what do he do with the ruler?

He count the distance between jakarta and the famous city around the world,
I think it's a great idea to turn into a script,
That's why I create this python scriptðŸ˜€

## City
Available city :
 * Tokyo
 * Seoul
 * Singapore
 * Angkara
 * Taipe

I am still disoriented to turn these hours into decimals number, please be patientðŸ˜‚
